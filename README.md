# Project-pi-be-less

This is a NodeJS application ready to be deployed to AWS via cloudformation. 

It's *one part* of my Computer science final project degree, [here](https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/145834/10/dperezloFBD0622report.pdf) you can check it, the first paragraf is in Spanish, the rest is in English. 

The NodeJS part is section 4.4 where the backend and deployment to aws is explained.
